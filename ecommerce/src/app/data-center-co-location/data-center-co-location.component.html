                      <p>A data center is a dedicated facility that efficiently stores, powers, cools, and connects your IT infrastructure. Colocation is one of many services that data centers offer. This includes hosting IT hardware (such as servers) in off-site data centers.</p>

                      <p>A colocation facility (colo) is a data center facility where companies can rent space for servers and other computing hardware. It provides the building, cooling, power, bandwidth, and physical security, while the customer provides the servers and storage.</p>
