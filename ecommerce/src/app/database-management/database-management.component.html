        Database management involves several tasks, including: <br><br>

      <strong>Data modeling: </strong> This involves designing the structure of the database, including tables, relationships, and constraints.<br><br>

      <strong> Data storage:  </strong> This involves deciding on the type of database to be used, the storage format for data, and the physical location of the database.<br><br>
        
      <strong>Data retrieval: </strong> This involves retrieving data from the database using query languages such as SQL.  <br><br>
        
      <strong>Data security: </strong> This involves ensuring that only authorized users have access to the data and that the data is protected against unauthorized access. <br><br>
        
      <strong> Data maintenance:  </strong>This involves updating, deleting, and adding data to the database, as well as performing regular backups and recovery procedures<br><br>
        
      
        
      Effective database management is critical for organizations that rely on data to support their business operations. It helps to ensure that data is accurate, reliable, and up-to-date, and that it is readily available to users when they need it.<br><br>
