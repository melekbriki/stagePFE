                <h2><strong>Efficient Resource Allocation</strong></h2>
                <p>Network management helps organizations optimize their network resources by identifying areas of overutilization or underutilization. By analyzing network traffic patterns and user demands, administrators can allocate resources effectively, ensuring that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth while non-essential activities do not disrupt overall network performance. This leads to cost savings and improved productivity.</p>

      <strong>Network monitoring: </strong> This involves tracking network performance and identifying any issues that may arise. Network administrators use monitoring tools to detect problems such as network congestion, bandwidth utilization, and hardware failures.<br><br>

      <strong> Network security: </strong> Ensuring the security of the network is another critical aspect of network management. This involves implementing security policies and procedures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and anti-virus software, to protect the network from unauthorized access and other threats.<br><br>
        
      <strong>Network configuration: </strong> Configuring the network involves setting up devices and software components to ensure that they work together correctly. Network administrators must ensure that the network components are properly configured to enable efficient communication and ensure data integrity.  <br><br>
        
      <strong>Network optimization: </strong> This involves fine-tuning the network to maximize its performance and efficiency. Network administrators may use tools such as load balancing, traffic shaping, and Quality of Service (QoS) to optimize the network. <br><br>
        
      <strong> Network troubleshooting: </strong> When network issues arise, network administrators must troubleshoot the problem and identify the root cause. This involves using various tools and techniques to diagnose and fix the issue. <br><br>
        
      
        
      Overall, effective network management is essential to ensure the smooth operation of computer networks and to provide users with reliable and secure access to resources and services.<br><br>
